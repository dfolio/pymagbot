# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Commit message convention

Commit messages must follow our convention based on the
[Angular style](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#format-of-the-commit-message)
or the [Karma convention](https://karma-runner.github.io/4.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html):

```
<type>[(scope)]: Subject

[Body]
```


**Subject and body must be valid Markdown.**
Subject must have proper casing (uppercase for first letter
if it makes sense), but no dot at the end, and no punctuation
in general.

Scope and body are optional. Type can be:

- `build`: About packaging, building wheels, etc.
- `chore`: About packaging or repo/files management.
- `ci`: About Continuous Integration.
- `deps`: Dependencies update.
- `docs`: About documentation.
- `feat`: New feature.
- `fix`: Bug fix.
- `perf`: About performance.
- `refactor`: Changes that are not features or bug fixes.
- `style`: A change in code style/format.
- `tests`: About tests.

If you write a body, please add trailers at the end
(for example issues and PR references, or co-authors),
without relying on GitHub's flavored Markdown:
